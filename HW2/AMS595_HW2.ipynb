        "When using assignment to set the value of a variable to immutable basic types, assignment creates a copy of the value. But for mutable objects assignment instead creates a pointer to the value being assigned, therefore meaning changes to the variable will change the orginal mutable object. Contrasting this with working with compound objects, a shallow copy creates a new compound object (such as a list) and then fills in the values as references to values of the orginal compound object. This means if you edit the shallow copy it doesnt change the orginal, but if you change the orginal it changes the shallow copy. Meanwhile a deep copy is a true copy in the sense that it creates a new compound object and then copies the values of the values of the original object into the new object, therefore meaning they are two seperate objects that will not change each other if either is edited. \n",

Each while loop then find the row below the current row by first intializng the below row as the [1] that begins every row of the triangle. Then a for iterates from i = 1 to length of the above row -1, and adds index i-1 and i from the row above the row we are finding. Then it adds the last [1] every row has, and sets this \"below\" row to the new current output row before increasing the counter by 1 and checking if the while loop should repeat again."
